My daily puzzle inputs would be in here in files named like `01.txt`, `02.txt`, etc.  

As the author of Advent of Code requests:

> "If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs."
 
I respect that wish and won't add my puzzle inputs in here. Therefore the unit tests will expect differing results to the solutions, if you decide to add your puzzle inputs in here.
